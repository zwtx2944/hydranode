Hydra Daemon is the daemon for the Hydra Panel.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/hydren-dev/HydraDAEMON](https://github.com/zwtx2944/hydranode.git`

2. Install dependencies:
`npm install`

3. Configure HydraDAEMON:
- Get your Panel's access key from the Hydra panel's config.json file and set it as 'remoteKey'. Do the same for the other way, set your HydraDaemon access key and configure it on the Panel.

4. Start the Daemon:

## Configuration
Configuration settings can be adjusted in the `config.json` file. This includes the authentication key for API access.
